Testnet Manager
==================

The [testnet manager chart](https://github.com/paritytech/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/testnet-manager) eanbles you to dynamically control test networks via a useful frontend GUI or API. It allows you to both view and modify information for nodes, validators and parachains in one place.

### Requirements

The testnet manager requires `sudo` access to the chains to perform management functions.

### Nodes

In the nodes section you can view all running nodes, their roles, chain, uptime, cli arguments and you can also view logs.

### Validator

This section allows you to register / deregister validators and also rotate session keys.

### Parachains

The parachain section allows you to register or deregister collators for a specific parachain.
